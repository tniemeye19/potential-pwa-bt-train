## Description
This Budget Tracker application allows the user to accomplish the following: 
- GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
- WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
- THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
- WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
- THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated

This application uses MongoDB as a database to store the data and indexedDB to add offline functionality.
